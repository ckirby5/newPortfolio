            <h2>I Work in Full Stack Web Development</h2>
            <p>I have been learning full stack web development for a year now. I began with <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and then began learning <strong>JavaScript/jQuery</strong>. 
                I have since then branched out to learn <strong>postgreSQL</strong> and python web frameworks such as <strong>Flask and Django</strong>.</p>
            <p>Along the way, I have also learned how to use git from a <strong>command line interface</strong> and have also used various linux distros such as <strong>centOS, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint</strong>.</p>
